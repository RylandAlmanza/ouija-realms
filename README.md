Ouija Realms
============

It's been over 200 years since that horrible experience in that horrible, cursed house that led to your death. Now, it is the end of times, and all the spirits of the dead are either ascending to heaven or descending to hell. Well, most of the spirits, at least. You have awoken from your slumber, but you are bound to the inside of the same house you died in, along with all the other lost souls that decided to venture into that god-forsaken house.

You know how to regain your freedom. You remember when you first walked into the house, long ago, the inscription carved into the door you used to enter the house. "The curse is lifted when the final demon is slain." You need to defeat all the demons lurking in the house. You cannot accomplish such a feat alone. You will need to get help from the other lost souls!

You start out in a random room of the house. You cannot see or interact with anyone at first. As you walk around, you will hear sounds, see things move, and feel shivers up your spine. These events will sometimes happen randomly, but other times they indicate the presence of one or more spirits. Spirits can be either lost souls (players) or demons (NPC's.) On the floor of every room, there is a Ouija board. If you think there is anyone or anything in the same room as you, you may use the room's Ouija board to try and contact them. Should you make a successful connection, you will be able to see and interact with the spirit (be it a lost soul or a demon,) and every other spirit that the contacted spirit can see. Those spirits will also be able to see you.

As lost souls use the various Ouija boards in the house, groups of them will be formed and often combined as they contact each other. Demons will be forming groups as well. Should a group of lost souls contact a group of demons, large battles may take place, killing off one group and leaving the other much smaller than before.

As you kill demons, you will gain experience and often level up. But if you die, your character is gone forever, and you will have to make a new one.

After all of the smaller demons in the house have been defeated, the door to the basement will be unlocked. The basement is where the final demon resides. In this room, all players can see each other. The final demon likes you to be able to see him kill all your allies. But maybe if there is enough of you, you can beat him!

When the final demon has been defeated, the game will restart in a new house with new demons. You get to keep your character and all your items, giving you an advantage in new games. But remember, if you die, you have to start again from scratch!
